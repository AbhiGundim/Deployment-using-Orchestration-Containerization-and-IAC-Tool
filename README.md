# Deployment using Orchestration Containerization and IAC Tool

To implement the DevOps lifecycle, the following detailed step-by-step guide will cover the setup of Git workflows, AWS infrastructure with Terraform, Docker containerization, Kubernetes cluster deployment, and Jenkins pipeline creation. This guide assumes basic familiarity with these technologies.

### 1. Version Control Setup with Git Workflow
- **Initialize the Git Repository**: Since the repository is already on GitHub at `https://github.com/hshar/website.git`, clone this repository to start managing the code.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/hshar/website.git
  cd website
  ```
- **Branching Strategy**: Implement a branching strategy where `master` is the main branch with stable code, and development happens in feature branches.
- **Release Management**: Setup a Git tag or release branch to handle monthly releases on the 25th. Automate this using GitHub Actions or a simple cron job to merge changes to a release branch.

### 2. AWS Infrastructure Setup Using Terraform
- **Create Terraform Configuration**: Define the required AWS resources such as EC2 instances, networking components (VPC, subnets, security groups), and IAM roles.
- **Terraform Initialization and Execution**:
  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform apply
  ```
- **Infrastructure Script**: Use the provided Kubernetes installation guide in the Terraform scripts or as a startup script for EC2 instances.

### 3. Docker Setup
- **Dockerfile**: Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project to containerize the application.
  ```Dockerfile
  FROM nginx:latest
  COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
  ```
- **Build and Push Docker Images**: Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the building and pushing of Docker images to Docker Hub upon code pushes to the master branch.

### 4. Kubernetes Cluster Deployment
- **Kubernetes Setup**: Follow the provided Kubernetes installation guide to set up the master and worker nodes using `kubeadm`.
- **Deployment and Service Configuration**:
  - `deployment.yaml`: Define the deployment to manage the lifecycle of your application.
  - `service.yaml`: Define the service to expose your application on a specific port.
- **Apply Configuration**:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
  kubectl apply -f service.yaml
  ```

### 5. Jenkins Pipeline Setup
- **Jenkins Installation and Configuration**: Install Jenkins on the designated EC2 instance, install suggested plugins, and set up necessary credentials for Docker Hub and GitHub.
- **Pipeline Script**:
  ```groovy
  pipeline {
      agent none 
      environment {
          DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('docker-hub-credentials')
      }
      stages {
          stage('Checkout Code') {
              agent { label 'jenkins-agent' }
              steps {
                  git 'https://github.com/hshar/website.git'
              }
          }
          stage('Build Docker Image') {
              agent { label 'jenkins-agent' }
              steps {
                  script {
                      sh 'docker build -t username/myapp:${BUILD_ID} .'
                      sh 'docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_USER -p $DOCKERHUB_PASS'
                      sh 'docker push username/myapp:${BUILD_ID}'
                  }
              }
          }
          stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
              agent { label 'jenkins-agent' }
              steps {
                  script {
                      sh 'kubectl set image deployment/myapp myapp=username/myapp:${BUILD_ID}'
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### 6. Monitoring and Logging
- **Set Up Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Set Up Logging**: Use Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana for logging.
